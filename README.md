# familyTree Test

## Unit Test

A unit test is used to test the validity of sections of code. A unit can be considered to be an arbitrary but logically isolated piece of code. Unit testing code using the Test Driven Development Cycle of "Red, Green, Refactor" can help save time later in a project by helping the developer spot and catch errors, bugs, and defects in code, before that code is integrated into a larger codebase. This in turn helps maintain code quality, and the reliability of software systems. Unit tests essentially backup or bring into dispute whether assumptions about a piece of software hold true, and prove that a piece of code works as intended. They can also help to document the code that is being written, so that at a glance the conditions under which the code should work can be extended or revised.

Using the familyTreeClass.js file's Person class as an example. An example of a unit within the code is the sayHello method; an example of a unit test for it is contained in the familyTree.test.js file, near the end of the file.
